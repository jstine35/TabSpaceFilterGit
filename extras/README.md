# Extra Scripts

* `spaces-to-tabs.sh`
* `tabs-to-spaces.sh`

These are just some extra tool scripts which are meant for reference or testing purposes.
They implement simplified tab/sace conversion for wildcard lists of file types.  Use of these
scripts is not necessary since GIT will do the filter conversions on its own after the filter
has been installed into a clone repository.
